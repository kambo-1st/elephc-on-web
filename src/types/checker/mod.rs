//! Purpose:
//! Defines the checker state and public type-checking surface for the compiler pipeline.
//! Owns cross-phase metadata including environments, declarations, warnings, FFI, classes, and required libraries.
//!
//! Called from:
//! - `crate::types::check()`
//!
//! Key details:
//! - Checker state is populated in ordered phases; later passes assume schemas, builtins, and signatures are complete.
